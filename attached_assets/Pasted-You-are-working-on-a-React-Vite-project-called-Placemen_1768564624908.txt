You are working on a React + Vite project called "Placement Prep Tracker".

CURRENT STATE:
- All UI works correctly
- Dashboard page is complete and should NOT be changed
- Clicking Login currently redirects directly to Dashboard

GOAL:
Implement a proper Register → Login → Dashboard flow.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT modify Dashboard UI or logic
- Do NOT auto-login users
- Use localStorage only (no backend)
- Keep changes minimal and clean

TASKS:

1. CREATE REGISTER PAGE
   - Route: /register
   - Inputs: Email, Password
   - On submit:
       - Save user into localStorage "users" array
       - If email already exists → show error
       - After successful registration → redirect to /login

2. CREATE LOGIN PAGE
   - Route: /login
   - Inputs: Email, Password
   - On submit:
       - Validate against localStorage "users"
       - If valid:
           localStorage.setItem("currentUser", userObject)
           redirect to /dashboard
       - If invalid → show error

3. FIX LOGIN BUTTON
   - Wherever the Login button currently exists,
     change it to navigate to "/login"
   - Do NOT redirect to dashboard directly

4. PROTECT DASHBOARD ROUTE
   - Dashboard must ONLY be accessible if:
       localStorage.getItem("currentUser") exists
   - If not logged in:
       redirect to /login

5. ROUTING FLOW MUST BE:
   - "/" → existing welcome/landing UI
   - "/register" → Register page
   - "/login" → Login page
   - "/dashboard" → Protected dashboard (existing UI)

6. LOGOUT (SIMPLE)
   - Add a Logout button (can be text)
   - On click:
       localStorage.removeItem("currentUser")
       redirect to /login

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Updated App routing
- Login page code
- Register page code
- Auth guard logic
- Clear list of files modified/added

IMPORTANT:
After this:
- User MUST register first
- Then login with same credentials
- Then reach dashboard
- Refreshing dashboard should stay logged in
- Logging out should block dashboard access
