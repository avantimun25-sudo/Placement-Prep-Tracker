You are modifying an existing JSP-based hackathon project
called "Placement Preparation Tracker".

CURRENT STATE:
- dashboard.jsp loads directly
- All features already exist (skills, progress, companies, goals, etc.)
- No authentication is enforced

GOAL:
Add a proper Login + Register flow and enforce authentication,
WITHOUT changing or removing any existing functionality or UI.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT auto-login users
- Do NOT redirect directly to dashboard.jsp
- Do NOT delete or rewrite existing pages
- Only ADD new files and SMALL guards where required

TASKS (DO ALL OF THEM):

1. Create login.jsp
   - Email input
   - Password input
   - Login button
   - Link to register.jsp
   - Form must POST to LoginServlet

2. Create register.jsp
   - Name, Email, Password
   - Register button
   - Form must POST to RegisterServlet

3. Modify index.jsp
   - It must be the ONLY entry point
   - Show app title and description
   - "Login" button → login.jsp
   - "Register" button → register.jsp
   - REMOVE any automatic redirect to dashboard.jsp

4. Add session protection to dashboard.jsp
   - At the TOP of the file (before HTML):
     If session userId is NULL → redirect to login.jsp
     Else → allow access

5. Ensure this behavior:
   - Opening the project shows index.jsp
   - Clicking Login goes to login.jsp
   - Directly opening dashboard.jsp redirects to login.jsp
   - Only after successful login can dashboard.jsp be accessed

6. DO NOT add database logic yet
   - Authentication can be mock (hardcoded user) for now
   - Focus ONLY on correct routing and session flow

7. Provide:
   - Full code for login.jsp
   - Full code for register.jsp
   - Modified index.jsp
   - The exact session-check snippet added to dashboard.jsp
   - Servlet stubs for LoginServlet and RegisterServlet
     (no DB logic, just session handling)

IMPORTANT:
This is for a hackathon demo.
Clarity and correctness matter more than complexity.
